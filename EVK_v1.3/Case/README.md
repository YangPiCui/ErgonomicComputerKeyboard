# Keyboard Case

## 0. 3D Printing the Components
Please refer to [v1.2](https://github.com/YangPiCui/ErgonomicVerticalKeyboard/tree/master/EVK_v1.2/Case#siemens-nx-modelling) for how the keyboard is designed.  
"./STLFiles/" constains the .stl files of the various parts.  
"./CuraSettings/" contains my Cura print settings  
Modelling uncertainty for part clearance: +/-0.25mm (tolerance 0.5mm)  
[My 3D printer parameters] (https://github.com/YangPiCui/3DPrinterCalibrationAndTuning/tree/master/DoogellVegaWithPLA)  

### Keycaps
Layer Height = 0.16mm  
KeycapHome X 12  
KeycapThumb X 4  
KeycapNormal X 74

Orientate them like this:

## 1. Assemble the Components





Make sure to update "ToleranceAndClearance.prt" for your own print parameters.  
"./NX_ErgonomicVerticalKeyboard/STL Files" constains Cura project files.  
I have modelled the case to be printed vertically and added tear-drop shaped M3 self-tapping pilot holes to do away with some supports:

Back of the left front case:

Both front cases with press-fit keycaps and hot-glued switches:

Front and back cases without connector rods and hand rests. I ran out of blue filaments, so I printed half of the right backplate with white filaments and glued it onto the existing part.
