# Design Letter and Symbol Layout
## 1. Physiology
Fingers' total usage should be proportional to their strengths, which is proportional to the cube of their diameters.

Diameter of my left index finder (LI): 56mm

LM: 54mm

LR: 53mm

LP: 47mm

So the ratio of finger key presses should be 1.69 : 1.52 : 1.43 : 1.

### Finger usage comes frome:
1. Clicking the mouse - current keyboard layout design ignore the usage of mouse. This creates over-usage of the index and middle fingers for programmers who game.
2. Typing letters.
3. Typing symbols.
4. Typing modification keys such as 'shift' and 'enter'.

## 2. Gather Frequency Data

### Mouse
Assume most people are right handed mouse users. Their right index and right middle fingers are used.

### Letters
The same multiple languages: English, Chinese, German and French (the common characters)
[English Letter Frequencies](https://norvig.com/mayzner.html)
[Chinese Letter Frequencies](http://xahlee.info/kbd/chinese_pinyin_letter_frequency.html)
Weight the frequencies with the ratio of total number of speakers of each language.

Scoring system:
1. switch 1 or 2 rows needs the other hand to type two letters to be optimal. Switching 3 rows requires the other hand to strike 3 times.

### Symbols
Get symbol frequencies for 'spaces', 'enter', 'comma'... from literature and from codes in (C++, Python, etc.).

### Modification Keys

how comfortably one presses simple operations such as 'ctrl + c' needs to be taken into account.
