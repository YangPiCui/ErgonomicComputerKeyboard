# Design Keyboard Shape 
## 1. Physiology
A 90 degrees tenting erects the spine better than a 60 degree one. Try it with your hands.  
Incorporate the radiating keycap layout from the [British patent 1,016,993](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=63415)  
Too many keys away from the home row makes touch typing difficult. As few keys as possible.  
Take average hand size, arm length, finger lengths and finger diameters from global population. Scale these variables to a single variable, such as height when changing the size of the keyboard.
