# The Design and Making of a Vertical Keyboard
## Introduction
A sore neck, and sore little fingers? 
Developing a stretched forth neck and a hump back? (A broken posture is terrible for attracting the opposite sex.)
The keyboard and the mouse are to be blamed, because they force our hands to lay flat on the desk pronated.

## Requirements:

1. Hands can rest on the desk with palms facing each other. This relaxes the shoulder and straightens the spine.

2. The keyboard takes up minimal&nbsp;space. This leaves room for the mouse.

3. Keyboard must be steady during single-hand typing. This is for gamers.

4. Concave design. This is to maximize finger comfort.

5. Mechanical switches or better.

6. Better key layout&nbsp;than qwerty. This is for the next generation human beings.

7. Must not be too expensive.

8. Must be open source and non-proprietary.

## [Part 1: Design Keyboard Shape](/design_keyboard_shape) 

Next step: 
decide:
1. buy new laptop, install Ubuntu, run 


## Part ?: Design Letter and Symbol Layout 


Fingers&#39; usage should be proportional to their strengths, which is proportional to the cube of their diameters.

What&#39;s the&nbsp;

Diameter of my left index finder (LI): 56mm

LM: 54mm

LR: 53mm

LP: 47mm

So the ratio of finger key presses should be 1.69 : 1.52 : 1.43 : 1.

Include usage of mouse. Most people are right handed.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

#### Letter and Symbol Frequency
For the letter layout:
The same multiple languages: English, Chinese, German and French (the common characters)

For the symbol layout:
Get symbol frequencies for 'spaces', 'enter', 'comma'... from literature and from codes in (C++, Python, etc.).
