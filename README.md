# The Design and Making of a Vertical Keyboard
## Introduction
A sore neck, and sore little fingers? 
Developing a stretched forth neck and a hump back? (A broken posture is terrible for attracting the opposite sex.)
The keyboard and the mouse are to be blamed, because they force our hands to lay flat on the desk pronated.

## Requirements:

1. Hands can rest on the desk with palms facing each other. This relaxes the shoulder and straightens the spine.

2. The keyboard takes up minimal&nbsp;space. This leaves room for the mouse.

3. Keyboard must be steady during single-hand typing. This is for gamers.

4. Concave design. This is to maximize finger comfort.

5. Mechanical switches or better.

6. Better key layout&nbsp;than qwerty. This is for the next generation human beings.

7. Must not be too expensive.

8. Must be open source and non-proprietary.

## Find a Company to Make This

Razer 

contact@ergodox-ez.com - will not make

info@safetype.com

steelseries.com

corsair - need more people requesting it with a value proposition

悠然自得数码 - need to create a 3D model first. 

## [Part 1: Keyboard Shape and Keycap Layout](/keyboard_shape_and_keycap_layout) 

Next step, decide:

 1. ~~Play with Clojure, Leiningen, OpenSCAD. I am learning C++ and want to master it. I don't want to confuse myself with the language syntaxes before mastering C++.~~
 3. ~~get the 3D model in Fusion 360. Can't find one.~~
 4. ~~Ask a friend to do it. Friend left.~~
 5. Buy a new desktop, take my sweet time, and design with my old good friend Solidworks.
