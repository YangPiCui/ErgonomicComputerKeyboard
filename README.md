The Design and Making of a Vertical Keyboard
Requirements:
1. Hands can rest on the desk with palms facing each other. This relaxes the shoulder and straightens the spine.

2. The keyboard takes up minimal space. This leaves room for the mouse.

3. Keyboard must be steady during single-hand typing. This is for gamers.

4. Concave design. This is to maximize finger comfort.

5. Mechanical switches or better.

6. Better key layout than qwerty. This is for the next generation human beings.

7. Must not be too expensive.

8. Must be open source and non-proprietary.

Keyboard Design Process



Letter Layout Design
Fingers' usage should be proportional to their strengths, which is proportional to the cube of their diameters.

What's the 

Diameter of my left index finder (LI): 56mm

LM: 54mm

LR: 53mm

LP: 47mm

So the ratio of finger key presses should be 1.69 : 1.52 : 1.43 : 1.

Include usage of mouse. Most people are right handed.
