# The Design and Making of a Vertical Keyboard
## Introduction
Sore neck and sore fingers from typing? A stretched forth neck and a hump back?  
A broken posture is unattractive. The keyboard and the mouse are the culprits. They force our hands to lay flat on the desk pronated. This in turn stresses our neck.  
Try rotating your palms to face each other. Do you feel your necks relieved, shoulder relaxed and spine straightened? This is the fix.  

## Requirements

0. Hands can rest on the desk with palms facing each other.  
1. The keyboard takes up minimal space, leaving room for the mouse.  
2. Concave design to maximize finger-comfort.  
3. Keyboard must be steady during single-hand typing/gaming.  
4. Uses mechanical switches.  
5. Optimized key layout. No more Qwerty layout.  
6. Inexpensive for mass adoption.

## [Keyboard Case](KeyboardCase) 

Next step:

 1. ~~Play with Clojure, Leiningen, OpenSCAD. I am learning C++ and want to master it. I don't want to confuse myself with the language syntaxes before mastering C++.~~
 2. ~~get the 3D model in Fusion 360. Can't find one.~~
 3. ~~Ask a friend to do it. Friend left.~~
 4. ~~Setup a new desktop computer and learn FreeCAD. (FreeCAD 0.18 and 0.19 has been way too inconvenient/problematic/buggy for me to design with.)~~ 
 5. ~~Learn Catia (Too expensive and no torrent)~~
 6. ~~Design the keyboard case in Siemens NX12.~~
 7. ~~3D print the case.~~
 8. Iterate Case Design

## [Character Layout](CharacterLayout)
Next step:
1. ~~Break down the problem into smaller parts for C++.~~
2. Figure out how to do simulated annealling. 

## [Manufacturing Requests](ManufacturingRequests)
No one wants to make it right now. So I will prototype it.
