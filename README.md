# The Design and Making of an Ergonomic Vertical Keyboard (EVK)

## Introduction
Do you get a sore neck and stiff fingers from typing? Have you developed a stretched forth neck and a hump back?  
The keyboard and the mouse are the culprits. They force our hands to lay flat on the desk pronated. This in turn stresses our neck.  
Now put your hands on the desk but rotate your palms to face each other. Do you start to feel your shoulders relaxed, your neck relieved, and your back straightened?  
A vertical keyboard that lets you type with palms facing each other will fix your unattractive broken posture.

## [Keyboard Case](KeyboardCase) 
EVK combines as much as possible the existing ergonomic features on the market:
- The case orientates the key caps into a vertical formation, so that palms face each other while typing.

- Concave design for more natural finger movements. [[Kinesis Advantage 2](https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/)  | [British patent 1,016,993](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=63415)]  
- Shift little fingers' extra columns to the index fingers to alleviate sore pinkies and to allow both hands to rest on the desk.
- Use an adustable, two part, split design to suit different individuals and to save desk space for other computer peripherals.
- Minimize the total number of keys for compactness and to save cost.   


## [Electronics, Firmware and Software](ElectronicsFirmwareAndSoftware)
- Use of mechanical switches. EVK v1.2 uses Cherry Silver switches.
