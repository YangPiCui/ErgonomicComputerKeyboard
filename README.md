# The Design and Making of a Vertical Keyboard
## Introduction
A sore neck, and sore little fingers? 
Developing a stretched forth neck and a hump back? (A broken posture is terrible for attracting the opposite sex.)
The keyboard and the mouse are to be blamed, because they force our hands to lay flat on the desk pronated.

## Requirements:

1. Hands can rest on the desk with palms facing each other. This relaxes the shoulder and straightens the spine.

2. The keyboard takes up minimal&nbsp;space leaving room for the mouse.

3. Keyboard must be steady during single-hand typing/gaming.

4. Concave design to maximize finger-comfort.

5. Uses mechanical switches.

6. Optimized key layout. Qwerty layout no more.

7. Inexpensive for adoption.

## [Step 1: Design Keyboard Shape and Keycap Positioning](/KeyboardShapeDesign) 

Next step, decide:

 1. ~~Play with Clojure, Leiningen, OpenSCAD. I am learning C++ and want to master it. I don't want to confuse myself with the language syntaxes before mastering C++.~~
 2. ~~get the 3D model in Fusion 360. Can't find one.~~
 3. ~~Ask a friend to do it. Friend left.~~
 4. ~~Setup a new desktop computer and learn FreeCAD. (FreeCAD 0.18 and 0.19 has been way too inconvenient/problematic/buggy for me to design with.) ~~
 5. Learn Catia
