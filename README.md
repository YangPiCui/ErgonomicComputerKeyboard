## Introduction
Do you get a sore neck and stiff fingers from typing? Have you developed a stretched forth neck and a hump back?  
The keyboard and the mouse are the culprits. They force our hands to lay flat on the desk pronated. This in turn stresses our neck.  
Now put your hands on the desk but rotate your palms to face each other. Do you start to feel your shoulders relaxed, your neck relieved, and your back straightened?    

The Ergonomic Vertical Keyboard (EVK) lets you do exactly that, and it also includes additional ergonomic features.
- The case orientates the key caps into a vertical formation, so that palms face each other while typing.

- Concave design for more natural finger movements. [[Kinesis Advantage 2](https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/)  | [British patent 1,016,993](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=63415)]  
- Little fingers' extra columns have been reassigned to the index fingers to alleviate sore pinkies.
- Better keymap than the QWERTY layout.
- Custom order of $700 upon email request. However, I have included all the necessary instructions for you to build this keyboard yourself! 


## Versions
