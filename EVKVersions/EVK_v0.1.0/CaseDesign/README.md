# Case Design 
I have previously outlined the [design process](https://github.com/YangPiCui/ErgonomicVerticalKeyboard/tree/master/EVKVersions/EVK_v0.0/Case#siemens-nx-modelling) with Siemens NX in EVK v0.0. Since then, I have found that
* A circular keywell works better. Our hands, not just our fingers, should also move while typing.
* A thumbrest is unnecessary. A free thumb is a more comfortable thumb.  
Below summary is based on EVK v0.1.2

Use the Family Part feature to generate keys for the other long fingers.   
Oriente the thumb keys with respect to the middle finger.
